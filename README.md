# Pokémon TCG 1999 - Nostalgia Web HACKATON 
This is a web project I created for the [CODEDEX](https://www.codedex.io/) Mini Winter Hackathon.

based on the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) 1999 era, specifically the first four expansion sets.
It’s a nostalgic journey into the past, filled with GIFs, sounds, and interactive elements that bring back memories from the Pokémon card game’s golden days.

## About The Project
The main feature of this project is the "Pokedex" page, where I focused the majority of my effort.
It serves as a database of the first four Pokémon TCG expansions, allowing visitors to explore the nostalgic designs of the cards from those sets.

On this page, users can view details of each card, relive the 90s vibes, and uncover hidden easter eggs throughout the site.

## Future Improvements
I would have loved to add more GIFs and fun elements to bring the site closer to the spirit of the 90s, but I ran out of time. However, I gave it my best effort!
